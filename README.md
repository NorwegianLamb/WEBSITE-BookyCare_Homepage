My team and I successfully passed the selection process for a **Startup Competition**, providing us with the opportunity to learn, compete with other teams, and network with prominent university professors and business angels.

Here is the **[link](https://startcupveneto.it/blog/conclusa-la-prima-giornata-di-formazione/) to that competition** (P.S. I'm the one in the middle with white hair, glasses and wearing all black).

I was responsible for leading the **IT team**, managing the **software architecture**, and **coding** the entire website and application for our startup. This experience enhanced my skills in designing and creating software from initial concepts and designs, collaborating effectively with the UI/UX design team, and working cohesively within a team environment.

## Info:
This startup's website is created using **REACT** for the front-end and **NODE** for the back-end.

Use ```npm start``` to initialize the project (NEED TO ADD RE-SIZE FEATURES)
